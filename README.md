Five-Star-Me
============

Five-Star-Me is a library to help you promote your android app by prompting users to rate the app after using it for a few days.<br>
It uses Android's [In-App Review API](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review) and is based upon @hotchemi's [Android-Rate](https://github.com/hotchemi/Android-Rate) library.

>Note: In order to test, the API requires the app be uploaded to the play store - *It connot be tested locally*. Read the testing guide [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/test).

## Install

You can download from jitpack.

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.hotchemi:android-rate:{latest.version}'
}
```

## Usage

### Configuration

Android-Rate provides methods to configure its behavior.

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

  FiveStarMe.with(this)
      .setInstallDays(0) // default 10, 0 means install day.
      .setLaunchTimes(3) // default 10
      .setDebug(false) // default false
      .monitor();

  // Show a dialog if meets conditions
  FiveStarMe.showRateDialogIfMeetsConditions(this);
}
```

The default conditions to show rate dialog is as below:

1. App is launched more than 10 days later than installation. Change via `FiveStarMe#setInstallDays(int)`.
2. App is launched more than 10 times. Change via `FiveStarMe#setLaunchTimes(int)`.
3. Setting `FiveStarMe#setDebug(boolean)` will ensure that the rating request is shown each time the app is launched. **This feature is only development!**.

### Clear show dialog flag

When you want to show the dialog again, call `FiveStarMe#clearAgreeShowDialog()`.

```java
FiveStarMe.with(this).clearAgreeShowDialog();
```

### When the button presses on

call `FiveStarMe#showRateDialog(Activity)`.

```java
FiveStarMe.with(this).showRateDialog(this);
```

## Support

Five-Star-Me supports API level 16 and up.
